          Hi, I am Ante Antonini, a software engineer working at Combis.
          Currently based in MetkoviÄ‡, Croatia.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main points of interest are on the frontend, specializing in
          React.js and TypeScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          My skillset includes engineering UI-s, implementing complex logic, as
          well as unit testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          What truly excites me about this field is its ever-evolving nature.
          I'm a staunch advocate for lifelong learning and make it a point to
          stay abreast of the latest industry trends, best practices, and
          emerging technologies. This commitment to continuous improvement fuels
          my aspiration to become a better developer with each passing day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of programming, I enjoy reading and working out. I am
          immensely interested in mental and physical performance which I relate
          to my overall productivity and health. Constantly learning, being
          useful and 1% better every day are the principles I live by.
        </p>
